					<p>Tired of the monotony of NEW YORK CITY corporate life,  Royce Bable, an ambitious 20-something, trades in his promising media [research] career for a one-way ticket to Southeast Asia.</p>

					<p>In his live ONE-MAN SHOW, Royce brings you on an 8-country adventure toward self-discovery. Not Here Right Now is an immersive live show experience where showgoers are treated to stories of Royce’s exciting journeys abroad, meet the characters who helped him find more of himself along the way, and learn that sometimes to be present means being Not Here Right Now. </p>

					<p>An Atlanta native, Royce has always been actively involved in arts, media and culture. He’s a proud graduate of the Tri-Cities High School Visual and Performing Arts Magnet Program, the Alma Mater of Atlanta legends,  Oukast and Kenan Thompson.</p>
					<p> Royce attended Howard University and spent his summers exploring the tech world in the Google Bold Internship Program. He graduated from Howard in 2010 with a B.B.A. in Marketing and spent the next few years hopping around with Nielsen in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. Royce’s love of travel led him to a 4 ½ month journey in Southeast Asia before returning to Atlanta to take a position at A3C Festival & Conference.</p>

					<p>Royce is currently the Director of Partnerships for A3C and is the Executive Producer of Not Here Right Now, a live one-man show about his Southeast Asian journey.</p>
